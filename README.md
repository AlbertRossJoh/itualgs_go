# ITU Algorithms - Go Edition
`itualgs_go` is mostly a Go port of the Java code in [Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). However it strives to be a general purpose library with all the data structures and algorithms needed.

## Target audience
`itualgs_go` should be for student currently wanting to learn algorithms specifically in go, but also specific users who might want to use the general purpose nature of this library.

## Affiliation with IT University of Copenhagen
This is an independent project conducted for educational purposes.

## Disclaimer
If you're currently enrolled in an algorithms course you should always try to do the solution yourself before looking for the answer, but if you're stuck you're more than welcome to steal this code ;)
